# HypermergeFS

Browse & edit Hypermerge documents. This VSCode extension was built to work with REaLM but should be mostly compatible with Capstone, PushPin, and other Hypermerge projects (though support is subject to the vagaries of research software version drift.)

* Check out this repo and open it with that Electron (Exploration build)
* Install a special Electron 3 build: https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/52629
* Run `npm install` to install module dependencies. (Not `yarn`! Fixes welcome.)
