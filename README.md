# HypermergeFS

Browse & edit Hypermerge documents. This VSCode extension was built to work with REaLM but should be mostly compatible with Capstone, PushPin, and other Hypermerge projects (though support is subject to the vagaries of research software version drift.)

* Download the VSIX file from the Releases page.
* In VSCode, type Ctrl-Shift-P, "VSIX" and you should see one command remaining in the filter.
* Choose the file you downloaded. You'll be prompted to reload the window.
* In the File / Documents tab, you should now see a HypermergeFS tab.
* Hover over the title of that tab, click the [...] icon, select "Open Document" and paste in a hypermerge document link.

You're off to the races!
